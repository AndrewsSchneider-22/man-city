        The longest serving manager was <strong>Wilf Wild,</strong> who was in charge from 1932 to 1946, for a total lenght of 14 years 6 months.
        However, as Wild's tenure covered the entire lenth of the <strong>Second World War,</strong> inwhich no competitive football was played,
        he is not the man with the most games served as manager. <strong>Les McDowall,</strong> who was in from 1950 to 1963, a priod of 13 years,
         managed the club for the most competitive games, a total of 592 games - a full 240 games more than Wild, who recorded the second most.
